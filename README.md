# 4th Kibo Robot Programming Challenge (Kibo-RPC)

**"YourService"** is the file that we developed Java programs via a methodology of Graph and an algorithm of Dijkstra to optimize the robot’s route for moving in
outer spaces and address uncertainties and errors via Linear Mapping. 

The 4th **Kibo-RPC.zip** includes all instruction manuals and codes for the Astrobee Robot to work in space, which was the summary information that we should provide for the 4th Kibo Robot Programming Challenge.

You are welcome to check it out.
